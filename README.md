# WilksCalculator

Attempt to create a Wilks Calculator similar to the regular ones, where you enter your total and weight, and your wilks score 
will be calcuated. I would like to add functionality in being able to select different attempts and see what your different 
wilks score would be.  Also, when the user is happy with the wilks score, and would like to save it, the user can do so, and
will be saved and shown in a table view!
